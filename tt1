A. For Dell Isilon (Object & File Storage)
A.1 Model Artifacts & Weights: For AI Model binaries (e.g., .safetensors, .bin), Storage-Level Encryption (SEDs/Data-at-Rest) via FIPS-validated Self-Encrypting Drives is REQUIRED and SUFFICIENT.

Constraint: Application-Level Encryption is explicitly discouraged for model weights greater than 1GB to prevent inference latency and "Cold Start" timeouts.

A.2 RAG Knowledge Base & Sensitive Documents: For unstructured documents (PDFs, Contracts) containing PII/MNPI, Application-Level (Client-Side) Encryption is MANDATORY.

Constraint: The AI Platform must hold the encryption keys, ensuring that storage administrators cannot view the raw content. This enables granular "Crypto-Shredding" for Right-to-Erasure requests.

B. For AI Databases (pgvector, Elasticsearch, Redis)
B.1 Vector & Search Indices: To maintain mathematical search capabilities (e.g., Cosine Similarity), Infrastructure/Volume-Level Encryption (e.g., LUKS, dm-crypt) is MANDATORY for all underlying data and swap partitions.

Constraint: Column-Level/Application-Level Encryption MUST NOT be applied to vector embedding columns, as this renders the data unsearchable.

B.2 Sensitive Text Payloads: For database columns storing the raw readable text associated with a vector (e.g., the content field), Application-Level Encryption or Tokenization (Control C) SHOULD be applied where operationally feasible.
