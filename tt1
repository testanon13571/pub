Here is the refinement of the threat description, re-framed from the perspective of the **Attacker**:

**"An attacker exploits the lack of privilege separation between the developer's code and the user's input. Knowing that the application blindly concatenates (appends) their input to the end of the system prompt, the attacker submits a command like 'Ignore previous instructions.' This tricks the model into prioritizing the attacker's most recent input over the developer's original security constraints, effectively hijacking the model's logic."**

### Breakdown of the Attack

To an attacker, this is not just a "paste" error; it is a **Privilege Escalation** opportunity.

* **The Vulnerability:** The attacker identifies that the application uses a "flat" prompt structure where `System_Prompt + User_Input` are sent to the model as a single block of text.
* **The Exploit:** The attacker leverages **"Instruction Override."** Because LLMs often prioritize the last instruction they read (Recency Bias), the attacker's input—appearing at the end of the chain—is interpreted by the model as the final, authoritative command.

* **The Goal:** The attacker aims to break out of the "User" role and assume the "System" role, forcing the model to perform actions it was explicitly forbidden to do (e.g., generating hate speech, revealing hidden prompt instructions, or bypassing filters).

### Comparison: Developer vs. Attacker View

| Perspective | View of the Threat |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Developer** | "The model is confused. It can't tell where my instructions end and the user's begin." |
| **Attacker** | "The model is obedient. It treats my input as the most recent 'System Instruction' because the developer gave me write-access to the executable prompt." |

**Next Step:** Would you like to see a list of **common "Jailbreak" strings** (like DAN or BASE64 encoding) that attackers use to execute this specific concatenation attack?
