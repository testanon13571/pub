Control ID,Control Name,Implementation Specification (G-SIB Standard)
ING-01,Strict Magic Byte Verification (Not Extension),"Do not rely on .pdf or .png extensions. Use a library like libmagic to inspect the file header (Magic Bytes) to confirm the true file type. Action: If Header != Extension, immediately quarantine and flag as Security Incident: Evasion Attempt."
ING-02,Sandboxed Content Disarm & Reconstruction (CDR),"Never process raw files directly in the embedding worker. 1. Explode: Convert complex formats (PDF/Docx) into flat intermediate formats (e.g., render PDF pages to high-res PNGs). 2. Sanitize: Strip all active content (Macros, JavaScript, embedded binaries, OLE objects). 3. Reconstruct: Re-assemble into a clean, text-only or flattened PDF for OCR. This neutralizes the ""shell script in a header"" attack."
ING-03,Adversarial Image Washing (Gaussian Filtering),To mitigate Multimodal Backdoors (pixel noise triggers): Apply a lightweight lossy transformation to all input images before they hit the model (Qwen-VL). Recipe: Resize to 95% -> Re-scale to 100% -> Apply mild Gaussian Blur (sigma=0.5) -> Re-encode as JPEG (Quality 90). This destroys the fragile high-frequency noise used in adversarial triggers without hurting human/AI legibility.
