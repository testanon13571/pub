Here is the **concise, executive-summary version** of the Security Control. This is streamlined for high-level documentation or presentation slides.

### **Security Control: Risk-Based Data Isolation**

**Policy:**
The AI Platform enforces a **Two-Tier Isolation Model** for search indices. Data residency is determined strictly by the data’s sensitivity classification.

**1. Tier 1: Physical Isolation ("The Vault")**
* **Applicability:** **Restricted / MNPI / Secret** (e.g., M&A, Private Wealth).
* **Control:** Dedicated, air-gapped index per project.
* **Requirement:** Must use separate encryption keys and allow for cryptographic deletion (crypto-shredding) upon project closure.
* **Access:** Strictly limited to the specific project's service account.

**2. Tier 2: Logical Isolation ("The Warehouse")**
* **Applicability:** **Confidential / Internal / Public** (e.g., General Banking, IT, HR).
* **Control:** Shared indices segmented by Division (e.g., Retail, Commercial).
* **Requirement:** Access is enforced via **Document-Level Security (DLS)** tags. Every query must include mandatory filter clauses to restrict view access.
* **Access:** Shared infrastructure, logically partitioned by user role.

**Default Rule:**
All new projects default to **Tier 2 (Logical)** to preserve infrastructure resources. Elevation to **Tier 1 (Physical)** requires explicit validation of High-Risk/MNPI status.
