Control Name,System Instruction Integrity & Output Sanitization
Control ID,AIC-07 (Example)
Risk Domain,Confidentiality (Info Disclosure)
Description,"The AI system must implement controls to prevent the disclosure of its underlying System Instructions (Meta-Prompts). This includes: 1. Instruction Hardening: Explicit directives in the system prompt forbidding self-disclosure.2. Refusal Standardization: Configuring the model to output generic, opaque refusal messages (e.g., ""I cannot answer this"") rather than detailed explanations of security logic.3. Leakage Filtering: Automated scanning of output text to detect and block the display of internal prompt identifiers or ""Canary"" tokens."
